## Goal:
The goal of this assignment will be to build a webpage that displays weather data based on a city search from the user. The page should display the current weather in that city, as well as a five day forecast. Weather data should include the city name, the date, weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. The UV index will be color coded to indicate normal, moderate, and severe levels. The city search will be saved and displayed on the page where the user can click on the city and retrieve city weather data.
